    <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
    <p>As-salamu alaykum ,
        I'm Md. Hasanur Rahman Riad. I was born & brought up in a middle-class Muslim family at Barishal, Bangladesh. Being the youngest member of my family, I enjoyed every opportunity to be spoiled by the unconditional love of my parents and siblings. Taking full advantage of those love around me, I  turned out as a passionate young man who can afford to run after his dreams (no matter how crazy or unrealistic they are!). 
        Currently, I'm studying at Daffodil International University, Department of Computer Science & Engineering (CSE). I passed my SSC at Charmonai Union Secondary School, Barishal, and HSC from Amrita Lal dey College, Barishal. 
        I also completed the course in Digital marketing from LDEP by Govt. I also Completed a Web design course in Dimension IT & Software.
        I'm a candidate in the other two running courses on  Python Learning & Web development.
        Addicted to Learning to code, Travelling, Watching Football, Playing Cricket, Chess, etc.</p>
